This add-on provides you with a modern emoji picker that you can use to find and select emojis (i.e. the emoticons/smileys you know from messengers such as 😃, 😎 or 🤪). You can <b>copy them into your clipboard</b> or <b>insert them</b> into the active page.
It uses up-to-date Emojis and lets you access your Emojis in different styles you know from different devices and applications.


<b>😊 Simple & effective! 😊</b>

You can then use the emojis on <b>almost any web page</b>, including your favorite messenger (such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Threema, Signal, Wire etc.), social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Mastodon etc.) and even e-mails.

It will remember your <b>recently used emojis</b> across sites. Additionally it may often be faster than the emoji picker on the website itself.

It is based on the awesome project <a href="https://missive.github.io/emoji-mart/">emoji-mart</a>. You can test many features on the website there already, without installing it.
This extension only works with Firefox v63 or higher.

It has an effective built-in search, so you can use it as an “emoji cheat sheet”. <b>Find exactly the emoji</b> you wanted to find with your search term!


<b>🎨 Choose the Emoji style you want! 🎨</b>

The add-on is very customizable and it lets you configure the up-to-date Emojis in different styles that you know from different devices and applications. Here is a list of styles, it supports:
